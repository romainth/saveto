Save To… - Share into a file
Share data from any app to save it into a file.

Exporting data from any app into a file made simple. Just open the share options, select "Save To…" and choose the target file. Done. No permissions required.

Very first release of "Save To…". Adds the app to the "sharing" and "open with" options on your device. When opened, allows to store the shared data into a file. It can then be viewed in the Gallery or another app.
